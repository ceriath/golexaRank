A library to access Amazon's Alexa Web Information Service API with Golang

The Amazon Alexa Web Information Services API was without a doubt one of the most confusing APIs I've worked with.
It wasn't impossible to work with but it could have been way simpler. The repository at https://github.com/ashim888/awis
 really simplified stuff for me.

APIs shouldn't have to be painful. In the interest of making AWIS easier to use with Go and in the interest of learning
the Go language, I thought I'd create a Python -> Golang port of the above Python library.
