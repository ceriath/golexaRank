A Go library to access Amazon's Alexa Web Information Service API (Alexa Rank)

The Amazon Alexa Web Information Services API was a confusing API to work with. It wasn't impossible to work with, but it could have been way simpler. https://github.com/ashim888/awis really simplified stuff for me.

APIs shouldn't have to be painful. In the interest of making AWIS easier to use with Go and in the interest of learning
the Go language, I thought I'd create a Python -> Golang port of the above Python library.

Check out the examples folder to get started.
